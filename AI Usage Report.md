# AI Usage Report

## AI Tools Used
- **GitHub Copilot**  
  - Inline VS Code suggestions for HTML/CSS/JS boilerplate  
  - Context-aware completions for Chart.js setup, utility functions, and CSS variables  
- **OpenAI ChatGPT**  
  - High-level architecture guidance (file structure, class design)  
  - Refining theme-toggle logic and `localStorage` persistence  
  - Drafting and polishing documentation (README sections, badges, contributing guide)  

## Key Use Cases
- Scaffolding: `index.html`, `style.css`, and initial `app.js` class structure  
- Chart.js: configuration snippets, responsive options, export routines  
- Theme handling: light/dark CSS variable sets, icon updates, chart re-initialization  
- Table features: pagination, sorting, filtering logic  
- Documentation: project description, setup instructions, tech-stack overview  

## Sample Prompts
1. “Generate a vanilla-JS dashboard scaffold with Chart.js charts, metrics cards, and light/dark theme toggle.”  
2. “Write CSS using variables and media queries to create a responsive grid layout for a dashboard.”  
3. “Implement sorting, pagination, and search filtering in JavaScript for a campaign performance table.”  
4. “Draft README.md sections covering project overview, installation steps, tech stack, and contributing guidelines.”  

## AI vs Manual Work Split
- **AI-generated (~60%)**  
  - Initial project scaffold: HTML layout, CSS variables, Chart.js boilerplate  
  - README drafts and markdown badges  
- **Manual coding (~35%)**  
  - Business logic: data loading, real-time metric animations, CSV export  
  - Table functionality: debounce search, dynamic pagination controls  
  - Cross-browser testing, asset path corrections, performance tuning  
- **Customization (~5%)**  
  - Merging AI snippets with code style conventions  
  - UI polish: spacing, icon placement, micro-interactions  
  - Final documentation edits and acknowledgements
