This report details how AI tools were leveraged throughout the development of the ADmyBRAND Insights Dashboard. It covers the tools used, key interactions, prompt examples, work distribution, and lessons learned.

## 🛠️ AI Tools & Extensions
| Tool             | Role & Contribution                                           |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| GitHub Copilot   | Generated boilerplate, utility functions, and CSS snippets.  |
| ChatGPT (GPT-4)  | Designed architecture, refined theme logic, and polished docs. |
| DALL·E           | (Unused) Reserved for potential custom graphics generation.  |

## 🔍 Detailed Use Cases & Interactions
> Below are the primary feature areas and how AI accelerated each step.
>
> 1. **Project Scaffold**  
>    - Prompt: “Generate a vanilla JS dashboard scaffold with Chart.js integration and responsive layout.”  
>    - Outcome: Base HTML/CSS structure, initial Chart.js setup.  
>
> 2. **Theme System & CSS Design**  
>    - Prompt: “Create a CSS variables design system supporting light/dark mode with focus states.”  
>    - Outcome: Full suite of CSS variables, media queries, and theme toggling logic.  
>
> 3. **Data Table Functionality**  
>    - Prompt: “Implement JavaScript for table sorting, filtering, pagination, and CSV export.”  
>    - Outcome: `initializeTable`, `filterAndSearch`, `sortTable`, and export logic.  
>
> 4. **Dynamic Charts & Real-Time Simulation**  
>    - Prompt: “Write functions to render revenue, user engagement, and traffic charts, plus simulated real-time updates.”  
>    - Outcome: Chart.js instances configured with custom tooltips and live data pulses.  
>
> 5. **Documentation & Deployment**  
>    - Prompt: “Draft README with project overview, setup, tech stack, and add Vercel/Netlify deployment guide.”  
>    - Outcome: Comprehensive README, `vercel.json` and `netlify.toml` configs, deployment checklist.

## ✏️ Sample Prompts & AI Responses
> Below are representative prompts and summarized responses.
>
> **Prompt:** “Write CSS variables for primary colors, spacing, typography, and shadows.”  
> **AI Response:** Generated a `:root` block with 80+ variables covering colors, sizes, and shadows.
>
> **Prompt:** “Add focus-visible styles and accessible navigation.”  
> **AI Response:** Provided `:focus-visible` rules, ARIA roles guidance, and keyboard navigation notes.

## 📊 Work Distribution
