# Introduction

ADmyBRAND Insights is a responsive, themeable analytics dashboard rebuilt with:
- React + Vite for a fast developer experience
- Chart.js (via react-chartjs-2) for interactive line, bar, and pie charts
- A CSS variables design system with a React `ThemeContext` for light/dark mode

This documentation covers architecture, setup, usage, and deployment for the React implementation located in the `code/` directory.
