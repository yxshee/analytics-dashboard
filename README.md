## Project Overview
ADmyBRAND Insights is a responsive analytics dashboard that visualizes marketing performance with interactive charts, tables, and real-time data simulation. Built with vanilla JavaScript, Chart.js, and a CSS variables design system, it provides a modular, themeable, and extensible foundation for future enhancements.

## Key Features
- **Overview Metrics:** Animated cards for revenue, users, conversions, and growth.
- **Dynamic Charts:** Line, bar, and doughnut charts using Chart.js.
- **Interactive Table:** Search, sort, filter, paginate, and CSV export.
- **Real-Time Simulation:** Metrics update every 30 seconds to emulate live data.
- **Light & Dark Mode:** CSS variables driven theme with persisted preference.
- **Data Export:** Download charts as PNG and table data as CSV.
- **Additional Insights:** Recent activities feed and conversion funnel visualization.

- **JavaScript (ES6+):** Class-based architecture, modular functions, and DOM manipulation.
- **Chart.js:** Configurable chart instances with custom tooltips and responsive behavior.
- **Local Storage:** Persist theme preference.
- **Accessibility:** Focus-visible styles, ARIA-friendly icons.
- **Performance:** Debounced search, pagination, and optimized interval updates.
